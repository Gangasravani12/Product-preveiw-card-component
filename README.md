 ## Project Structure
   * **HTML Structure**
     
     The project utilizes the following HTML structure:

        It comprises both the head and body sections.
       Within the body section, a div element with a relevant class name is used to encapsulate the product display elements, including img, h1, and p tags. This structured approach 
       facilitates the presentation of the product information in the desired format.

  * **CSS Styles**
    
     The project's styling is defined in an external CSS file, typically named "style.css." Key CSS styles applied include:

      * Background color for the body tag.
      * Styling for the product container div tag.
      * Styling for the product image img tag.
      * Text alignment, color, and typography for h1 and p elements.
